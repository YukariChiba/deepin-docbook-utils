Definition: docbook frontend runs sgmlnorm on xml input,
 WARNING: I know very little about the docbook toolchain! Please 
          double-check and triple-check my suggestion. Works For Me (tm)
          
          
 Running 
 
 db2html foo.xml
 
 causes unnecessary long waits (up to 30 seconds or so) if the 
 input document is an XML document.
 
 I traced down the problem to the file 
 /usr/share/sgml/docbook/utils-0.6.13/frontend/docbook (which is
 called from /usr/bin/jw). Apparently it runs 'sgmlnorm' even
 over XML documents (which should be expected to be well-formed, no?).
 This is because $SGML_NORM is set to either 'sgml' or 'xml' in 
 /usr/bin/jw in any case (and exported), so that the check in docbook
 will always lead to sgmlnorm being used.
 
 To me it seems unnecessary to run sgmlnorm over XML input, but I 
 may well be wrong :)
 
 If there is something to it, please have a look at the attached
 patch, which works fine for me and fixes those long waits for me.
